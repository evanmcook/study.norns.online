for many years, i've seen and wondered about monome hardware, but either could not understand *what exactly was going on over there* because of my own progress in understanding audio, or could not afford to participate once i progressed my understanding further.

[the norns shield](https://monome.org/docs/norns/shield/) was my foot in the door.
with hindsight as my guide, here are some words that would have helped me understand things quicker.

#some words
* norns is a small linux computer
* the computer does many things
* others have taught the computer many functions
* you are free to make your own functions, but you do not have to
* many of the functions, norns itself, and documentation of the aforemented are works in progress (including this)

#standing on the shoulders 
* i am lucky to have the privilege of an education which gave me time and support to understand to varying degrees: osc, midi, arduino, computer networking, and file structures
* i am also lucky to have had much support from [the norns study group discord](https://discord.com/invite/hfC5Fmw), whose members i am grateful for.

#on our feet
when my norns shield arrived in the mail, i followed [this guide](https://monome.org/docs/norns/shield/) for assembly and software, followed by [devine's tutorial](https://llllllll.co/t/norns-tutorial/23241) to get my norns shield connected to wifi. connectivity is necessary to transfer files to your norns shield, add new programs to your norns shield, and to edit the code that lives on your norns shield.

#stopping to tinker
i found devine's tutorial to be extremely helpful in learning a lot about many basic norns ideas, but wanted to
